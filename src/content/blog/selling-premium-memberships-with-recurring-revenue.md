For creators and aspiring entrepreneurs looking to generate a sustainable recurring revenue stream from their creative work, Ghost has built-in payments allowing you to create a subscription commerce business.

Connect your Stripe account to Ghost, and you'll be able to quickly and easily create monthly and yearly premium plans for members to subscribe to, as well as complimentary plans for friends and family.

Ghost takes **0% payment fees**, so everything you make is yours to keep!

Using subscriptions, you can build an independent media business like [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/), [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/), or [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com/).

The creator economy is just getting started, and Ghost allows you to build something based on technology that you own and control.The Browser has over 10,000 paying subscribers

Most successful subscription businesses publish a mix of free and paid posts to attract a new audience, and upsell the most loyal members to a premium offering.

Hold back some of the best bits for paying members only!

The Public preview card allows to create a divide between how much of your post should be available as a public free-preview, and how much should be restricted based on the post access level.

These last paragraphs are only visible on the site if you're logged in as a paying member. To test this out, you can connect a Stripe account, create a member account for yourself, and give yourself a complimentary premium plan.
