It's possible to extend your <Notation type="highlight" color="yellow">Ghost site</Notation> and connect it with <Notation type="box" color="blue">hundreds</Notation> of the most <Notation type="underline" color="red">popular</Notation> apps and tools using integrations.

Whether you need to automatically <Notation type="circle" color="blue">publish</Notation> new posts on <Notation type="strike-through" color="blue">social media</Notation>, connect your favorite analytics tool, sync your community or embed forms into your content — our integrations library has got it all covered with hundreds of integration tutorials.

Many integrations are as <Notation type="crossed-off" color="blue">simple</Notation> as inserting an embed by pasting a link, or copying a snippet of code directly from an app and pasting it into Ghost. Our integration tutorials are used by creators of all kinds to get apps and integrations up and running in no time — no technical knowledge required.

## Zapier

<Notation type="bracket" color="red">Zapier is a no-code tool that allows you to build powerful automations, and our official integration allows you to connect your Ghost site to more than 1,000 external services.</Notation>

> Example: When someone new subscribes to a newsletter on a Ghost site (Trigger) then the contact information is automatically pushed into MailChimp (Action).

_Here's a few of the most popular automation templates:_

## Custom integrations

For more advanced automation, it's possible to create custom Ghost integrations with dedicated API keys from the Integrations page within Ghost Admin.
These custom integrations allow you to use the Ghost API without needing to write code, and create powerful workflows such as sending content from your favorite desktop editor into Ghost as a new draft.
